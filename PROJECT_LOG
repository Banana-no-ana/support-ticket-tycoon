Backlog: 
    * Need worker to be able to advance through some of the case scenarios.
    * How does the "customer" respond? 
    * We'll definitely need a database.
    * Somepoint a frontend will be good to have. It should be able to display the workers.
    * Need a service to keep track of the cases. Some sort of a document database?


Stage 1: Scenario 1 - Manual assign some cases
    * Be able to generate cases
    * Manual assign cases (Don't need auto assign yet.)
    * Workers work through a case
    * View cases and workers on a frontend - so we actually can do some assign 


Day 1 (Oct.7): Stubbed out a master clock and worker. 
    Master clock can now tick on whatever is registered with it 
        Basically every X seconds send a url request to its /tick
