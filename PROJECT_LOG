Backlog: 
    * Need worker to be able to advance through some of the case scenarios.
    * How does the "customer" respond? 
    * We'll definitely need a database.
    * Somepoint a frontend will be good to have. It should be able to display the workers.
    * Need a service to keep track of the cases. Some sort of a document database?
    * At some point we're going to need to write tests. 


Stage 1: Scenario 1 - Manual assign some cases
    * Be able to generate cases
    * Manual assign cases (Don't need auto assign yet.)
    * Workers work through a case
    * View cases and workers on a frontend - so we actually can do some assign 


Day 3 (Oct.11)
    * Wanted to get to a UI, but instead made some parts of the API layer.
    * Thought about game engines. Maybe need to do unity. There's also this framework: https://love2d.org/, not sure if worth. Can also consider Construct 3
        * I need the game engine to draw characters. But that might be able to be done with just simple animation
            * Might also need panning and zooming, not sure if flutter can just do that. 
    * Starting learning a little about grpc. 


Day 2 (Oct.8): Did some tutorials on flutter and dart. Not sure I completely understand it all. 
    Flutter seems to be writing dart with a bunch of UI stuff peppered in. But seems to be kinda bloaty. 
    Watched this tutorial on flutter/dart + go + rpc. Super useful: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Vd9sV8_uDrQ


Day 1 (Oct.7): Stubbed out a master clock and worker. 
    Master clock can now tick on whatever is registered with it 
        Basically every X seconds send a url request to its /tick
